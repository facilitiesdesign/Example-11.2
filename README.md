# Example-11.2

A furniture manufacturer has expanded his operations and purchased five new machines to be placed in a newly renovated building adjoining an existing facility. Because of the shape of the building and process requirements, the manufacturer has decided to arrange the machines in a single row. The cost to move an average load through unit distance is $1.00. The machine dimensions are listed 
in Figure 11.15, which also gives the horizontal clearance required between each pair of machines (in meters) as well as the frequency of trips estimated to be made per year for the foreseeable future. The machines are to be arranged so that their longer sides are parallel to the aisle. Formulate a linear programming model like LMIP 1 and solve it using an LMIP software.

For this problem, a linear programming model is solved using Gurobi optimization software and a Python interface is provided in github.com/facilitiesdesign. We present LINGO computer printout of the model input and partial solution output next. Variables whose values are not shown in the solution output have a value of zero
